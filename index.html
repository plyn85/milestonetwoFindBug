              The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from
              Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for €222 million (£198 million)
              in August of 2017.​Neymar's move from Barcelona to PSG in 2017
              didn't so much break the world transfer record as smash it into a
              million pieces. He became the first player to command a
              nine-figure sum, with the £198m fee being more than double the
              previous record of Paul Pogba.
