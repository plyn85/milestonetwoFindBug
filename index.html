              transfer record fee of £80 million (€94 million).However, in
              January 2016, documents pertaining to the transfer were leaked by
              Football Leaks which confirmed a world record transfer fee of
              €100.8 million

              The current transfer record was set by the transfer of Neymar from
              Barcelona to Paris Saint-Germain for €222 million (£198 million)
              in August of 2017.​Neymar's move from Barcelona to PSG in 2017
              didn't so much break the world transfer record as smash it into a
              million pieces. He became the first player to command a
              nine-figure sum, with the £198m fee being more than double the
              previous record of Paul Pogba.
